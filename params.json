{"name":"Zinc","body":"### Introduction\r\nZinc allows OS X users to sync their media libraries with any device that they choose. Just choose the source directory (where all the media is), choose the target directory (where you want it to be), and sync.\r\n\r\nZinc is awesome because it keeps the libraries in sync - if you add media to or remove media from the source directory, then the same changes will be made to the target directory on sync. It's also really small - 181 KB.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nI wanted to be able to sync my iTunes library (DRM free) with my Android devices. Other solutions required large/clunky/ugly desktop clients or tied me down to one media player on the Play Store. \r\n\r\n### How? \r\nZinc was actually a first for me - I wrote it in `Applescript`. I used the `Cocoa-AppleScript` template in Xcode. The actual work is done by `rsync`.\r\n\r\n### Screenshot\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/rDRri.png)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nZinc is open source and is distributed under the MIT License:\r\n\r\n\tCopyright © 2012 Mihir Singh <me@mihirsingh.com>\r\n\r\n\tPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of \r\n\tthis software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in \r\n\tthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to \r\n\tuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of \r\n\tthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do \r\n\tso, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n\tThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all \r\n\tcopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n\tTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY \r\n\tKIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE \r\n\tWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR \r\n\tPURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
